# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description: 
>The left browser is the actual user, browser A. The right browser is in incogito to simulate an hacker, browser B. Login into the website in A. Using the browsers developer network tool to locate the session id. This session id can be used to login as the actual user without username & password credentials. In browser B, visit the website at /public/hacktools/change_session_id.php and paste the user session id to login.
